# Pixel Desk Display

This project is a quick and simple full stack app meant for my gf and her little sisters to write anything on a website and upload it to a display on my work desk.

## Structure

I wanted to stray away from current dev trends of using "NextJS + ShadCN" to ship anything and everything into production
This will (hopefully) teach me better API configuration and management and (hopefully) teach me Devops.

- Frontend
  - ReactJS
  - Tanstack Router + Query
  - TailwindCSS

- Backend 
  - ExpressJS
  - tRPC

- Display
  - Python

## Progress

### Foundations
- [x] Create a basic grid that can be drawn on

## Questions, concerns, and other info

If you love the project and want to copy what I have feel free to! I will try my best to make it structured enough for anyone to pickup and go
I will write three blogs/reports on the main components.

1. For the website design
2. For the Raspberry Pi design
3. For the connections between the two

I might even make a video for it. Who knows :D
